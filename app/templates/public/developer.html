    <h3 class="subtitle is-3">How does it work?</h3>
    <p>
    To become a developer on Dreaming Spires, you must first register an
    account and then prepare the required information for the verification
    process.  You will need to submit a CV, a description of your
    past experience, and a short paragraph describing the sorts of jobs you're
    interested in.
    </p>

    <p>
    We will assess your application and may invite you for an online interview.
    The interview will consist of a short chat where we get a feel for your
    experience level, and will involve various problems designed to test your
    abilities.  It will take no more than 20 minutes.
    </p>

    <p>
    Provided your application is successful, you will become a registered
    developer!  You will be able to take on jobs from the marketplace, and
    begin working on interesting problems!
    </p>

    </p>
    <h3 class="subtitle is-3">What do we look for in applicants?</h3>
    <p>
    We are looking for applicants with an aptitude for solving varied problems
    and a commitment to free software.  Your application is more likely to be
    successful if you have formal education in Computer Science and/or have practical
    experience developing software in other organisations.
    </p>

    <p>
    We are not too concerned with the amount of time you have to devote to
    development work - once you've been verified, the working schedule is
    entirely up to you and the projects you select.  However, to keep your
    account open you will be required to complete at least one project every six
    months.
